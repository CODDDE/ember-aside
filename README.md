# ember-aside

Draggable aside menu components.

Shamelessy inspired on [ember-side-menu](https://github.com/tsubik/ember-side-menu) :) but refactored to use contextual components.
This approach makes easy to introduce multiple, specialized lateral menus not possible with the original addon.
Example: main "hamburger" menu on the left side while having a secondary menu for settings/filters specifics of
the current visualized page.
